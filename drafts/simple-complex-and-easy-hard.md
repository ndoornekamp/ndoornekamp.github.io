title: Simple vs. complex (and easy vs. hard)

Complex originates from 'complected', which means 'to be braided together': something made up of multiple parts that are intertwined. Because of this 'intertwinedness' it is harder to reason about these parts; they may interact in non-obvious ways.

(This is now also how I remember the difference between complex and complicated: something can be complicated but consist of one part, whereas something complex consists of multiple intertwined parts.)

Note also how this differs from the distinction between easy and hard.

For example: if you always bring your car to a garage for maintenance and repairs, your life is now (somewhat) braided together with that of the garage. However, doing all of these things yourself would probably be hard. So: doing the easy thing increases complexity.
On the other hand, if you do all maintenance and repairs yourself, your life is less complex (less intertwined with that of the garage), but it is probably harder.
